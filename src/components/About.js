            <p>I love connecting and building relationships with people and spent the last five years working in the service sector. 
            I have positively enjoyed my experience as I have had the opportunity to meet people from all parts of the world.</p>

            <p>Beyond developing connections with people, I am driven by the creative process and my enthusiasm for learning new information and skills. 
            I have spent the better part of the last year researching career prospects that merge these interests. And with a leap of faith, 
            I enrolled in the University of Denverâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp. </p>

            <p>As it turns out, I love web development!</p>

            <p>I love how web development allows me to work closely with others, 
            challenges me to learn new things and creatively solve problems. Within the scope of the program, 
            I have met other budding tech professionals, and have learned languages that have made it possible for me
            to start with a simple idea and transform it into a functional web application.</p>

            <p>I am actively pursuing a software development position that will allow me to continue my technical education in a professional environment. 
            I am interested in innovative and challenging projects that positively impact lives and foster community development. </p>
